# Simple-Linear-Regression-
The goal of this project is to build a simple Linear Regression model that predicts house prices based on the area (sqmt). By using machine learning, we can estimate property prices based on historical data, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Overview
This project uses a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on the area in square meters. It is implemented using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn to train the model and visualize the results.

Dataset
The dataset file, homeprices.csv, contains two columns:

Area in square meters
Price in dollars
Example data:

Area (sqmt)       Price ($)
-----------------------------------
1000                |      250000
1500                |     350000
2000                |     450000



Output Example

Enter Area to Predict Price: 1800
Predicted Price is: 400000

The actual values depend on the dataset.




Future Enhancements

- Use multiple features like bedrooms and location for better predictions.
- Improve accuracy by implementing polynomial regression.
- Deploy the model using Flask for web-based predictions.
